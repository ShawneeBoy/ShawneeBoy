**Shawn Sihyun Lee**

I'm currently serving as a military interpreter in the ROK Army, but I plan to join Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science in Fall of 2022.
During my military service, I plan to use some of my free time to solve algorithm problems and do some personal projects.
